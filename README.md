# Bike-Sales
A excel project to provide insights on bike sales from raw data.


In this project, I showcased my Excel skills by walking through the data cleaning process, analysis, and dashboard creation to provide insights from raw data:

Data Cleaning:
- Found and removed 26 duplicate records.
- Standardized data using Find and Replace (Ctrl + H):
- Converted “M” to Married and “S” to Single.
- Changed “M” to Male and “F” to Female for consistency.
- Formatted the Income column as currency and reduced decimal places.

Data Transformation:
- Created Age Brackets with an IF formula:
    =IF(L2<=31, "Youth", IF(L2<54, "Middle Age", "Old"))

Data Analysis via Pivot Tables:
- Generated a pivot table to compare the average income of males and females who did or did not purchase bikes.

Developed three pivot tables to explore:
- Age groups with the highest bike purchases.
- Income levels most associated with purchases.
- Commuting distances of buyers.

Interactive Dashboard with Slicers:
- Added slicers to make pivot tables and charts interactive and versatile to allow dynamic filtering.
This project demonstrates my ability to clean data, generate meaningful insights with pivot tables, and enhance dashboards with interactive elements, making the analysis user-friendly and insightful.
